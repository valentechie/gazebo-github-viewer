# Gazebo GitHub Viewer

Automatically visualize changes to robotic models (URDF, SDF, Xacro) from GitHub repositories in the Gazebo simulator.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to help robotics teams and educators review and validate robot model changes collaboratively and efficiently.  
Whenever a commit or pull request modifies model files in a GitHub repository, the application will automatically download the changed files and launch them in Gazebo for instant visualization.

Currently, this repository is **in early development**. The main goals are:

- Receive notifications of model changes (via GitHub Webhooks).
- Download modified URDF, SDF, or Xacro files from the repository.
- Automatically launch the updated models in Gazebo for review.

## üì¶ Planned Technologies

- **Python** (backend logic and GitHub integration)
- **Gazebo** (robot simulation)
- **GitHub API / Webhooks** (change notifications)
- **Docker** (optional, for easy setup and running)
